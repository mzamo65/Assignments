----How to use DeCMS:----
*************************
----GETTING STARTED----
In order to run this program, you need to have Java SE Development Kit 15 installed on your device.
This can be downloaded from the link below:
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html
Follow the steps in the install wizard to install it, and once it is done, you are ready to go.

----RUNNING THE PROGRAM----
To start the application, simply double-click the "run.bat" file or "DECMS.jar"
(the command terminal will open alongside the User Interface if started with "run.bat")
Two text files will be generated upon the first run, this is completely normal and contain information the program needs to keep track of.

----HOME----
In the middle of the home page, a list of all the downloaded websites is displayed.
Double clicking on one of your recent downloads will open the file directory in which it is saved.
At the top right of the home page, there are some drop down menus, this is what they do:

>File:
In the file dropdown menu
>>New URL:
This opens up the download panel.
>>Open: 
This brings up the file browser and can be used to open up any of the downloaded websites' HTML file. 
>>Settings:
This opens the settings page for you to configure the behaviour of the program. 
>>Exit:
Exit close the program. Clicking the X at the top right of the application will also do this. 

>Edit:
>>Clear Recent Download History:
This deletes the download history. And we all know why that is important. :^)

>Help:
>>View README:
This displays the very README.txt that you are reading now! Congratulations! 

----DOWNLOAD PANEL----
This is the bread and butter of this program; as this is how we go about starting a new download, and downloading a website.
Once we have selected this option, a new interface will be displayed. 
> Text Box
Front and centre, is the text box where the URL must be entered. 
> Select Directory Button
Allows the user to select the directory in which they wish the website to be saved.
> Download Button
The download only begins after this button is pressed. 
>Cancel Button
This cancels the download and closes the dialog once pressed. 
> Check Box
If the open file after download tick box is ticked before you pressed the download button, then the file will be opened after it is downloaded. 

Once a download has been completed, the window will close. You can start another download at any time by using the Menu bar on the main window.

----SETTINGS PANEL----
This is the configuration menu, here you can adjust the default directory of your downloads, default user agent, and how many links the program should download.
> Choose Directory
Opens a menu which you can select your default download directory. If you edit this setting, you will not need to select a directory before clicking "Download" on the download panel.
> UserAgent Dropdown
Allows the user to select the default user agent to be used when accessing the web pages. You can normally leave this as-is. If you don't know what a user agent is, you don't have to worry about this setting.
> Select Layers Dropdown
The select layers option lets you choose between "One" or "As Far as Possible" - use at your own risk
> Reset to Default Settings
This button resets all of the program's settings to their default values
> Close
Closes the settings interface
